hello,
It is my first time using java to build project, the name of this project is School Management system.
It is normal school setup where a Principal can admit or expel a Student and a Teacher can teach a course.
Also, a Student can take a course.

Striing line = "1 , Vincent , 12";
line.split(" , ")
//String[] newResult = ["1" , "Vincent"];
newResult[0] = "1";
newResult[1] = "Vincent";
newResult[2] = "12";
Student student = new Student(newResult[0] , newResult[1] , newResult[]);
ArrayList<Student> studentList = new ArrayList<>();
studentList.add(student);
